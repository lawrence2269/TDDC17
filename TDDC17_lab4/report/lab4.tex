\section*{Task 1}

We have chosen to model Shakey's domain.
In the domain we have the following six different objects:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{box}: a box that Shakey can push between connected rooms.
    \item \textbf{switch}: a light switch that can be turned on or off.
    \item \textbf{room}: a room where a light switch, object, box or Shakey can be.
    \item \textbf{shakey}: Shakey the robot.
    \item \textbf{object}: a small object that Shakey can hold.
    \item \textbf{gripper}: a gripper that Shakey can use to hold a small object.
\end{itemize}
We also have the following nine predicates:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{adjacent}: specifies wether two rooms are connected.
    \item \textbf{wide-entrance}: specifies wether the two rooms that are connected have a wide door.
    \item \textbf{box-at}: specifies if a specific box is in a specific room.
    \item \textbf{shakey-at}: specifies if Shakey is in a specific room.
    \item \textbf{switch-at}: specifies if a specific light switch is in a specific room.
    \item \textbf{object-at}: specifies if a specific small object is in a specific room.
    \item \textbf{light}: specifies wether a specific room is lit.
    \item \textbf{holding}: specifies if a specific gripper holds a specific small object.
    \item \textbf{empty}: specifies if a specific gripper is not holding anything.
\end{itemize}
Finally we have the following seven actions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{move}: moves Shakey from one room to another if Shakey is in the first room and there is a door between the rooms.
    \item \textbf{lights-on}: Shakey turns on the lights in a room if there is a box and a light switch in the room.
    \item \textbf{turn-light-off}: Shakey turns the lights off in a room if there is a box and a light switch in the room.
    \item \textbf{move-box}: Shakey moves a box from one room to another.
    \item \textbf{pick-up}: Shakey picks up a small object in one of its grippers.
    \item \textbf{put-down}: Shakey puts down a small object from one of its grippers.
\end{itemize}
